# Hostel Management System - Java Project

## Overview
This project is a **Java-based Hostel Management System** designed to simplify the operations and management of hostel-related activities. It provides a user-friendly interface for both hostel administrators and students, integrating GUI components and JDBC connectivity to maintain hostel records efficiently.

## Features

### Admin Module
- Add, view, update, and delete student records  
- Room allotment and vacancy tracking  
- Manage hostel fees and status  

### Student Module
- View personal hostel information  
- Room and fee details access  

### Database Integration
- JDBC used for seamless backend connectivity with MySQL  
- Secure, structured storage of hostel-related data  

### User Interface
- Developed using Java Swing for GUI  
- Menu-driven interfaces for ease of navigation  

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Java (JDK 8+)  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - JDBC for database connectivity  
  - Java Swing for GUI components  
- **Tools**: Eclipse IDE / IntelliJ IDEA  

## Dataset
A sample CSV dataset (`oops_dataset2.csv`) is included to simulate database interaction during development and testing.

## Project Structure
- `Admin.java` â€” Admin dashboard for hostel management  
- `Student.java` â€” Student-side interface  
- `DBConnection.java` â€” JDBC connection handler  
- `Main.java` â€” Entry point
